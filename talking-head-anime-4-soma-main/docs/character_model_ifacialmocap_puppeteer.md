## Usage

1. Run iFacialMocap on your iOS device. It should show you the device's IP address. Jot it down. Keep the app open.

   ![IP address in iFacialMocap screen](images/ifacialmocap_ip.jpg "IP address in iFacialMocap screen")

2. Invoke the `character_model_ifacialmocap_puppeteer` application.

3. You will see a text box with label "Capture Device IP." Write the iOS device's IP address that you jotted down there.

   ![Write IP address of your iOS device in the 'Capture Device IP' text box.](images/ifacialmocap-puppeteer-device-ip.png "Write IP address of your iOS device in the 'Capture Device IP' text box.")

4. Click the "START CAPTURE!" button to the right.

   ![Click the 'START CAPTURE!' button.](images/ifacialmocap-puppeteer-start-capture.png "Click the 'START CAPTURE!' button.")

   If the programs are connected properly, you should see the numbers in the bottom part of the window change when you move your head.

   ![The numbers in the bottom part of the window should change when you move your head.](images/ifacialmocap-puppeteer-moving-numbers.png "The numbers in the bottom part of the window should change when you move your head.")

5. Now, you can load a student model, and the character should follow your facial movement.
